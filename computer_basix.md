- x86-64 (aka x64, x86_64, AMD64 and Intel 64) is the 64-bit version of the x86 instruction set. popular among computers.
- x86 is a family of backward-compatible instruction set architectures based on the Intel 8086 CPU and its Intel 8088 variant.
- Instruction set architecture (ISA)(programming model) is an abstract model of a computer.(machine language)
  - instruction set consists of addressing modes, instructions, native data types, registers, memory architecture, interrupt, and exception handling, and external I/O.
  - Micro architecture is a way ISA, is implemented in a particular processor.
