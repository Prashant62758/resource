##### Conclusion
- Webm is another excellent video format just as MP4 format. These two formats together are used in lots of Internet sites to serve HTML5 video, because both together offer maximum compatibility (while mp4 formats can be played in devices with iOS, and modern versions of Internet Explorer, webm videos can be played in chrome and firefox browsers). See how to convert videos into mp4 format.
- Webm encoding process is much slower than mp4 encoding process with libx264.
- Webm is better in quality-compression ratio than mp4 with libx264. You can have a high quality video in less space, so if you want to store videos and video size is an issue you should consider this format.
